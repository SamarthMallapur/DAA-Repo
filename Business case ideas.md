## New skill development center
Our city Goutham is surrounded by a few small villages, who are skilled in traditional agriculture, forest product collection and craftsmanship. Hence, building new skill development centres would further help the citizens to improve their skills, and the children can learn these skills if they are required to.


## Utilizing the Woman Workforce
Almost 90% of the women in the nearby villages are unemployed/homemaker. Hence, an industry which is suited for women workforce would be a good business case idea. ex:A Textile industry.


## Small Scale Industry
The locals of this region are expertise in bamboo crafts, wood carving and traditional embroidery. Building small scale industries mass producing their products carries high potential for a business.


## Agricultural produce transport
The farm products need to be transported to nearby APMCs, through trucks. Currently, trucks are scarce, and the price increases dramatically during high demand. Introducing a transportation company would be highly successful. Now, as the trucks are readily available, the prices can be maintained to a certain extent, while providing employment.


## Manufacturing locomotives
The barren land available in the region is around 13%-15%. A railway workshop exists in a nearby village known as “Dahod”. Upgrading this facility to manufacture locomotives or coaches creates high employment. Indian railways are searching for new plant sites, making this the perfect opportunity.
